# Weather-Prediction-using-Regression

**This project is contributed by POOLA CHARAN.**

Here in the project, we predict the weather using a supervised learning method called "linear Regression".  This is simple way of analyzing the weather data and predicting the weather.

## How to run the project:

1. Replace the path of the dataset in the second line of the notebook file.
2. Now run the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Thank you!
